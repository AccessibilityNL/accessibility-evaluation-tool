It provides options that allow you to input information about the website and the evaluation, including the evaluation results. It helps you follow the steps suggested by WCAG-EM, and to generate a structured report from the input that you provide. None of the input is required and you can go back and forth between the steps in any sequence. Once you are done providing input you can download and further customize the report to your liking.",

  "INTRO_STEP1": "Provide the overall scope of the evaluation, such as the website name, the web pages in scope of the evaluation, the conformance target, the accessibility support baseline, and any additional evaluation requirements. This step is ideally carried out in consultation with the evaluation commissioner (who may or may not be the website owner) to ensure common expectations about the scope of the evaluation. Initial exploration of the target website during this step may be necessary to better know specifics of the website and the required evaluation. Detailed exploration of the website is carried out in the next step.",
  "INTRO_STEP2": "Explore the target website to be evaluated, to develop an initial understanding of the website and its use, purpose, and functionality. Much of this may not be immediately apparent to you, in particular if you are from outside the development team. In some cases it is also not possible to exhaustively identify and list all functionality, types of web pages, and technologies used to realize the website and its applications. The initial exploration carried out in this step is typically refined in the later steps, as you learn more about the target website. Involvement of the website owners and website developers can help you make your explorations more effective.",
  "INTRO_STEP3": "Select a sample of web pages and web page states that is representative of the target website to be evaluated. The purpose of this selection is to ensure that the evaluation results reflect the accessibility performance of the website with reasonable confidence. In cases where it is feasible to evaluate all web pages and web page states of a website, which is highly recommended, this sampling procedure can be skipped and the 'selected sample' in the remaining steps of this evaluation process is the entire website. In some cases, such as for small websites, sampling may result in selecting all web pages and web page states of a website.",
  "INTRO_STEP4": "Record the outcome of your auditing of all of the web pages and web page states selected in the previous step, and compare the structured sample to the randomly selected sample. The audit is carried out according to the five {0} at the target conformance level defined in the Step 1. You can provide results globally for the entire sample, or you can select 'show results for individual pages' to provide results for particular web pages and web page states. To manage the amount of information being displayed you can also select particular pages in 'sample to evaluate', for example to show only the particular page that you are currently auditing.",
