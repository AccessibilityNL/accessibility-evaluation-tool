        This tool helps you generate a report according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/">Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM)</a>.
        It does not perform any accessibility checks.
        It helps you follow the steps of WCAG-EM, to generate a <a href="/evaluation/view-report">structured report</a> from the input that you provide.
        It is designed for experienced evaluators who know <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2</a> and are somewhat familiar with WCAG-EM. For an introduction to WCAG-EM, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/conformance/wcag-em/">WCAG-EM Overview</a>.

        All functionality provided by this tool is now loaded and running
        locally in your web browser. You don't need an Internet connection
        beyond this point. When you close your web browser window, any unsaved
        data is lost.
      `,
      `
        All input that you provide through this tool is recorded as JSON data
        in the background (in your web browser, not on any server). You can
        Save periodically as you work to avoid losing data if your web browser
        closes.
      `,
      `
        You can save partially-complete reports and work on them later. To
        reload a saved file, use the 'Open' link at the top and find the file
        that you previously saved.

        You can go back and forth between the steps in any order.
        None of the fields are required.

        To get more information about a field,
        select the Info expand icon next to the field label.

        The tool provides your report as HTML and CSS files.
        You can download these files from the 'View Report' page.
        You can then change the report content and visual design.
      `,
      `
        You can include in your report WCAG 2 success criteria beyond the conformance target.
        For example, the website is only required to meet Level AA,
        yet you want to also include Level AAA success criteria in the report.
        In step 4, use the level filter to show higher level criteria.
        Any criteria with a result will always be included in the report.
