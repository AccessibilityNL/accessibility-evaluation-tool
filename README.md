WCAG-EM Report tool is an assistent that takes the user
through the process of evaluating the accessibility of a
website, using the WCAG-EM Evaluation Methodoloty. The Report
Tool runs entirely on the client and so it can be used offline
and in any server configuration available to you. 

The Report Tool does not save files to a server or in local 
storage. Rather, load and save functions are available for
storing an evaluation to your local file system.

# Install

Before you can install the WCAG-EM Report tool you will need
to install a few components:
- NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/
- Ruby   https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/

In addition to these, you will need to install grunt cli. To do
so run the following command. This will install the grunt
command line interface in a global space on your machine.
    
    npm install grunt-cli -g

Now with all global dependencies installed, the following 
commands will install the app and its dependencies

    git clone git://github.com/w3c/wcag-em-report-tool.git
    gem install compass
    npm install
    bower install

# Usage
You can launch a development version by running:

    grunt serve

To create a build in the /dist folder run:

    grunt build

The build version can be hosted in on any server that available
on http(s). WCAG-EM Report Tool runs in your local browser, so
it only loads static files from the server.

## Localisation
Files for localisation are part of the `app/locale/` directory. By default
the 'en' folder will be used. To serve or build the app using the `--lang`
flag, and give it what directory to use as the default language, i.e.
`--lang nl` will build with `app/locale/nl` as the default language.

# Data format
Data in the WCAG-EM Report Tool is saved and can again be loaded in a JSON
format. The data format is [JSON Linked Data](http://json-ld.org/), and
uses [EARL](http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) to store the test results.

Custom fields are based on WCAG-EM and are documented in [dataformat.md].
