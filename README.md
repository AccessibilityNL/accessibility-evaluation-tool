# Accessibility Evaluation Tool

The Accessibility Evaluation Tool is an assistant that takes the user through the process of evaluating the accessibility of a website or application using the WCAG-EM Evaluation Methodology.

The current primary audience this tool targets are accessibility experts with knowledge of the wcag and the evaluation methodology.

> :bulb: This tool has been :hocho: knifed from the [WCAG-EM-Report-Tool](https://github.com/w3c/wcag-em-report-tool). Relevant history has been transported over as much as possible.
