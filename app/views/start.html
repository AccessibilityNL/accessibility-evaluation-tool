<h1>Start an accessibility audit</h1>

<p>Evaluating the extent to which a website conforms to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<acronym>WCAG</acronym>) 2.0</a> is a process involving several steps. The activities carried out within these steps are influenced by many aspects such as the type of website (e.g. static, dynamic, responsive, mobile, etc.), its size, complexity, and the technologies used to create it (e.g. <acronym>HTML</acronym>, <acronym>PDF</acronym>, etc.), how much knowledge the evaluators have of how the website was or is being developed, and the main purpose for the evaluation (e.g. to issue an accessibility statement, to plan a redesign process, to perform research, etc.).</p>

<p>This methodology, describes the steps that are common to website conformance evaluation processes. It highlights considerations for evaluators to apply these steps in the context of a particular website. It does not replace the need for quality assurance measures that are implemented throughout the design, development, and maintenance of websites to ensure their accessibility conformance. Following this methodology will help evaluators  apply good practice, avoid commonly made mistakes, and achieve more comparable results. It supports common approaches and understanding for evaluating the extent of conformance of websites to <acronym>WCAG</acronym> 2.0, though in the majority of use cases it does not directly result in conformance claims.</p>

<p><strong>This methodology does not in any way add to or change the requirements defined by the normative <acronym>WCAG</acronym> 2.0 standard</strong>, nor does it provide instructions on feature-by-feature evaluation of web content. The methodolody can be used in conjunction with techniques for meeting WCAG 2.0 success criteria, such as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques for <acronym>WCAG</acronym> 2.0</a> documented by <acronym>W3C</acronym>/<acronym>WAI</acronym>, but does not require this or any other specific set of techniques.</p>
